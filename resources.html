                <p><span class="bold">Resource 1</span>: <span class="underline">Hard Fork</span>. While I do not find this podcast to be completely unbiased, I feel that it has an interesting view and up to date news on technology--especially artificial intelligence--which is important for me to keep up with consistently as an ITI professional.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Resource 2</span>: <span class="underline">Upwork</span>. This website is something I learned about during my 2025 fall internship. While it is useful for making money and getting jobs, I find it far more useful for gaining experience with practical, hands-on work. It takes time to get clients, but when you do, the work you do is priceless for your portfolio and technological understanding.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Resource 3</span>: <span class="underline">Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub</span>. This was a resource I learned about during the 2025 SC&I Mingle networking event. This is a community that young data scientists can use to engage in projects with like-minded individuals and bolster their field knowledge.</p>
