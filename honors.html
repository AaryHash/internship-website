                <h1>My Honors/Interests</h1>
                <p><span class="bold">Accomplishment 1</span>: An accomplishment that I am proud of in my personal life is something I call "<span class="underline">FebruAary 2025</span>". In February 2024, I made my first attempt at broadcasting on my Twitch channel every day for the entirety of the month, as my own challenge to force myself to be creative. It was a fun event, but it had a lot of room to grow.</p>
                <p>In 2025, February was a busy month for me, but I wanted to keep the event going yearly. So, in September, I launched "FebruAary 2025", and I streamed every day of the month alongside my senior fall semester, data analyst internship, and other important expectations. This event ended up being far better than its predecessor, with more creativity, more viewers, and an emphasis on managing my time properly.</p>
                <p>I feel this accomplishment allowed me to prove many things to myself. First, that I am not incapable of creativity, and if I push myself, I can feel creatively fulfilled. Second, that I can incorporate technology into my creativity in a fun and exciting way, as I continued to iterate on my stream throughout the month and well after. And third, that I am capable of balancing all of my different priorities in my life, largely due to my own emphasis on learning better time management and organizational skills. Overall, it was a huge success for me emotionally, creatively, and technologically.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Accomplishment 2</span>: Another big, recent accomplishment that I am proud of was one that occurred in October 2025. I was the Events Director on the Rutgers Esports Executive Board, and I had been trying to introduce the club into the broader collegiate esports environment.</p>
                <p>Red Bull flew out 1 member each from 30 of the top collegiate esports programs in the country this summer, and I was lucky enough to be one of them. We went to Los Angeles to network and ideate, and it made it clear to me that Rutgers was not putting enough effort into engaging with its peers. As such, as soon as I got a chance, I decided to set up a <span class="underline">cross-college event</span> hosted by Rutgers.</p>
                <p>In October 2025, I managed to put together and host a tournament in the competitive video game Marvel Rivals, and streamed the entire event live from my own bedroom, alongside two of my team members. It took a lot of effort to get together, including preparing graphics, promoting it on social media, and ensuring every team (amounting to 20+ people) were prepared, informed, and on time. In the end, it went as smoothly as we could have hoped, and I was incredibly proud of my ability to plan the event and integrate Rutgers Esports more deeply into the broader community.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Interest 1</span>: My main interest, which I have figured out after working internships and analyzing how I spend my time in my day to day life, is <span class="underline">development</span>. In my 2025 summer internship at OmniSOC, I learned a lot about cybersecurity and maintaining a secure organization, and I have a lot of respect for the people who do it. But, I learned from that experience that my passions lie more with building solutions to problems, especially by using technology in some way. After the internship, I analyzed my own life and realized I often find myself seeking ways to engage in this practice, and the times I got to do something in this vein were my favorite times during my summer internship. I also enjoyed tasks like these during my 2025 fall internship.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Interest 2</span>: Another interest of mine is <span class="underline">video editing</span>. It feels like a beautiful balance of creative thinking and technological understanding. Figuring out how to properly use different forms of video and audio, troubleshoot missing frames or corrupted files, and then turn them into a cohesive piece of media is a difficult but fulfilling task. It is in a similar vein as my first listed interest, but alongside the act of developing the final product, I also simply enjoy working with the programs and files, and making thoughtful decisions with every edit to ensure I am building something I am proud of.</p>
