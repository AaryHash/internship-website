                <p>In this site, you will find my goals and intended pathway, work experience, accomplishments, interests, and more. I take a lot of pride in what I do, including creating this website from scratch using HTML and CSS, and I hope that shows as you dig in.</p>
                <p>I also hope you can learn a bit about me! I have a lot of love for tech in various ways, but I also enjoy reading, watching FCBarcelona games, and exercising when I manage to get myself away from a screen. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:aps249@scarletmail.rutgers.edu">contact me</a> if you want to reach out about technical projects I might be interested in or mutual interests that we share!</p>
