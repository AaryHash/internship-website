                <h1>My Community of Practice</h1>
                <p>A social group I joined that is connected to ITI was the Major League Hacking community. This community has monthly hack weeks that bring professionals in to educate community members about different aspects of technology, like getting started with AI/ML or working with APIs. Along with these workshops, there is a Discord server where community members can chat with each other, and a website where members can go to view different projects that they can take part in.</p>
                <p>One of the events I took part in was their Open Source Global Hack Week. This was a week dedicated to learning about the open source technological community, one of the pillars of the Internet that often goes unnoticed. We learned about engaging with open source projects, properly using and crediting others' projects, and publishing our own for future hackers to use.</p>
                <p>This community has been a major boon in my technical experience and enjoyment. People like this, who want to learn and educate and explore, are good to surround oneself with. Technology is so powerful that it can easily be used in dangerous ways, and I feel that communities such as this help me keep sight of the good it can do with the right mindset behind its usage.</p>
